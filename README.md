## Challenges

1. Let's revisit the Star Wars API Project that we did a few weeks ago. A character has many films, a film has many characters. How would you model this out in plain old ruby? What models would you need?
2. How would you model this out in SQL? What tables would you need? What keys would be on those tables?
3. What SQL would fire when trying to select all of a characters films?
